Introduction
	My background
	| extensive experience testing in Java and Ruby
	| This is a talk I wanted to go to but I didn't see it anywhere
	| So I created one myself
	| This is a beta!
	TDD Recap (Bild)
	| Ask if needed
	Behavior Driven Development
	| Background for my interest
Simplistic View
	Standard JUnit Test
		Segfaults JVM
		| On all platforms as well
Everything found in android.test
| Do notice the proliferance of classes suffixed 2 etc
Based on JUnit3
| methods start with test
| I don't really mind as I haven't done a lot in JUnit4
Android Tests are separate applications (Bild)
| A whole new .apk is installed
Weird Things
	Surprising effects of XML editing
	| semantic checks of XML attribute values
	|
	Everything extends View
	Buttons Extend TextView
Creating ActivityUnitTestCase
| We will start here as we want to work with the behavior
	assertTrue;
	assertNotNull(getActivity)
	| fails for no setup and you need to startIntent:
	| Intent.getIntent(Intent.ACTION_DEFAULT)
| 
ActivityTestCase4343543
| show effect of not having setup()!
| do clickButton() _without_ @UIThreadTest
	Do some clicking of buttons
